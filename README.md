# 🚀 Get started 

      It should be one of our mission to improve everyday for the better

I am happy when I can improve myself just 1% everyday.

Reminding: Do you have a choice not to do it?


      "Do I have a choice of doing this task which I am procrastination?" IF no > DO IT NOW: It costs me more by doing it the last minute.
