"**It should be one of our mission to improve everyday for the better**"

I am happy when I can improve myself just 1% everyday.

Reminding: Do you have a choice not to do it?

"Do I have a choice of doing this task which I am procrastination?" IF no > DO IT NOW: It costs me more by doing it the last minute.
